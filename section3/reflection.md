## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?  
My workflow felt very different this week. Taking short breaks about every 45min, allowed me to stay more focused for longer periods of time over all.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?  
I am still having difficulty setting intentions.  None of them seem real.  I need to get better at picking intentions that ore more outside of my comfort zone. I am finding myself better at estimating times to complete tasks the more i use a stop watch to time my exercises.


3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?  
A hash is a non order collection of key-value pairs.  It is like an array except indexing is done by arbitrary keys instead of integers.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.  
```
pet_store = {  
  "dog_food" => 10,  
  "cat_food" => 12,  
  "chew_toy" => 3,  
  "cat_liter" => 5,  
  "hamster" => 6  
}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?  
`states["IA"]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?  
```   
states.keys   
states.values
```

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?  
You might use a hash to pair some names with their respective phone numbers.  Hashes would work better because the name is more representative of the phone number than a simple integer index would be.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?  
Don't really have any questions regarding hashes. Just trying to memorize the syntax.
