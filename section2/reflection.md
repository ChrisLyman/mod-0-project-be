## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?  
As a manager most of my previous career, I always asked my employees to flex a little out of their comfort zone so that they could grow.  
Before I started programming, I never realized that making mistakes would be that much of the process.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?  
Currently i believe that I demonstrate a growth mindset by asking questions like, "If I change this what happens?" or "Why?"  
I do not demonstrate a growth mindset when I hesitate to ask questions.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.  
A conditional statement is used to perform a certain set of instructions if a specified condition is met.  
```if/else    
unless    
until```

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?  
To decide whether a certain statement or block of statements is executed or not.  

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?  
```if x == y  
  puts "yes"    
end ```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?  
By adding `elsif` & `else`.  

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:  
```x = 2  
y = 2  
if x > y  
  puts "yes"  
elsif x < y  
  puts "no"  
else  
  puts "maybe"  
end```
